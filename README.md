# cPInstall - Description
cPInstall is a small bash script initially created for UnderHost customers and then released to the public. Its purpose was to provide access to install, optimize, and secure common cPanel plugins with one click. Although useful for novices and helpful for advanced users, this project has been discontinued.

The product has been moved to a cPanel internal plugin, which we believe might not be as useful today. However, we will still release the cPanel plugin to the public once the code is wrapped up and our branding is removed, adopting the GPL license instead. This bash script will remain available, but some features may be potentially out of date.
